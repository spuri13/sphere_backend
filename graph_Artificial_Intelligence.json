It encompasses narrow AI (task-specific systems like voice assistants) and general AI (hypothetical human-level intelligence). AI powers everyday tools like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. Key challenges include ethical concerns like bias and job displacement, privacy issues, and the difficulty of creating systems that can reason and understand context like humans.",
